Profiling and Monitoring Tools
Introduction
The benchmarking module provides several tools for monitoring and profiling the benchmarks that are run. These tools include logging, setting up environment variables for using the popvision profiler, and extracting and calculating key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and compile time.

Prerequisites
The user should have Graphcore's SDK installed on their system.
The user should have the necessary hardware and software setup as per the Graphcore's SDK requirements.
Logging
The benchmarking module provides well-organized and separated logging functionality. The logs are saved in a structured format and include information about the benchmark that was run, the environment in which it was run, and the performance metrics that were recorded.
The logs can be easily accessed and analyzed to understand the performance of the benchmark.
Environment Variables
The benchmarking module also provides functionality for setting up environment variables for using the popvision profiler. This allows the user to profile their benchmarks and understand the behavior of their models at a low-level.
The environment variables can be set as follows:
Copy code
    from benchmarking_module import EnvSetup

    env_setup = EnvSetup()
    env_setup.set_popvision_env()
Performance Metrics
The benchmarking module provides functionality for extracting and calculating key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and compile time from the logs. These metrics can be used to understand the performance of the benchmarks and identify any issues that may be affecting performance.
The performance metrics can be calculated as follows:
Copy code
    from benchmarking_module import PerformanceCalculator

    calculator = PerformanceCalculator()
    calculator.calculate_metrics("log_file")
Conclusion
The benchmarking module provides several tools for monitoring and profiling the benchmarks that are run. These tools include logging, setting up environment variables for using the popvision profiler, and extracting and calculating key performance metrics. These tools allow the user to understand the performance of their benchmarks, identify any issues that may be affecting performance, and optimize their models for better performance.
